# Topic 1 : An introduction to database systems and concepts. <br><br>
Topic 1 covers what is a database and database management system. <br>Throughout the course, we will use MySQL, workbench for RDBMS. <br>
The different terminologies, as well as modeling and design using relational databases, is introduced.<br>
<br>
### Objectives:<br>
1. Explore the various types of databases and why they are valuable assets for decision-making.<br>
2. Create an Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) model for a relational database.<br>
3. Explain what entity integrity and referential integrity are and why are they important in a database.<br>
4. Create teams and understand the members' roles and responsibilities.<br>
5. Demonstrate an understanding of a database.<br><br>

### Assignment 1:
Constructing a model in a relational database using ERD allows students to understand and practice modeling concepts in relational databases.

Create an entity relation diagram (ERD) model (using correct connection symbols for relations) for a relational database based on the Crow's Foot notation using the following requirements:

1) An INVOICE is written by a SALESREP. <br>
2) A sales representative can write many invoices, but an invoice is written by a single sales representative.<br>
3) The INVOICE is written for a single CUSTOMER. However, each customer can have many invoices.<br>
4) An INVOICE can include many detail lines (LINE); each Line describes one product and the number of products, as well as total cost bought by the customer.<br>
5) The product information is stored in a PRODUCT entity.<br>
6) The productâ€™s vendor information is found in a VENDOR entity. (You may assume each vendor can have many products and a product can be obtained from many vendors.)
